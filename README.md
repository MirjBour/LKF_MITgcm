# LKF Detection with MITgcm
This repository contains scripts for detecting Linear Kinematic Features (LKF) in MITgcm output data. The primary script 'detect_dataset_MITgcm.py', uses several utiliy functions defined in other .py files in this repository.

All .py files you can find in here are modified versions of Nils Hutter's LKF detection functions [here](https://github.com/nhutter/lkf_tools/tree/main/lkf_tools) and [here](https://github.com/nhutter/lkf_mitgcm2km/tree/main)
